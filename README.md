## Features 🛠️

1. 💡 Prompt Suggestions <br>
On the landing page, four sleek cards suggest different types of prompts you can give, so you're never left wondering what to ask.

2. ⌨️ Prompt Input Box <br>
Below the cards lies a glorious input box where your imagination takes flight! Type your prompt and let Gemini work its magic.

3. 📜 Sidebar for History <br>
Keep track of your past prompts (and maybe a few regrettable ones – we’ve all been there 🙃) with the intuitive sidebar.

4. ⏳ Loader Animation <br>
While waiting for a response, enjoy our hypnotic loader animation, crafted to soothe your soul during those brief moments of suspense.

5. 🖋️ Typing Effect <br>
Watch the response appear like a typewriter in action. It’s oddly satisfying, like ASMR for your eyes. 👀

6. 🌙 Dark Mode <br>
Because we care about your eyeballs. The entire app is wrapped in the warm, comforting embrace of dark mode. 🖤
